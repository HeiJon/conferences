# Symfony Conference Videos!

Hi there! As *cool* as we think the SymfonyCon and SymfonyLive videos are, this tutorial
specifically probably isn't very interesting: it holds some metadata, transcripts and...
that's about it, for the Symfony Conference videos on SymfonyCasts.

❤️ Your friends at SymfonyCasts
