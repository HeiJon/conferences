## Talk Abstract

Have you heard of Symfony HttpClient? This new component is part of Symfony 4.3. How about experimenting with it by launching "compose require symfony/http-client"? That is what I propose you do at this conference. We will review its features and essential characteristics. Enough to replace Guzzle et al.? Undoubtedly as far as I am concerned :)
