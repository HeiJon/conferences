## Talk Abstract

Static analysis is performed on source code without actually executing it. Being a good companion for code reviews it is often used for quality assurance as part of continuous integration. It can also play an invaluable role when diving into an unfamiliar code base.

Due to its ruthless nature, static analysis lets the team to focus on business problems, rather than arguing typos. It will also point out design issues, possible maintenance problems or bugs. Should we trust it blindly though?
