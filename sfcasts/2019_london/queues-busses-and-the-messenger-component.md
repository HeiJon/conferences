## Talk Abstract

Message queues are the perfect way to decentralize your application. You may use them for communication, scheduling and decentralization of your application. With help from a message queue you may decouple your application from the framework and the infrastructure. Which means that your app is written in pure PHP and not Symfony/Laravel/Yii etc.

With some smart configuration on your message bus you may put the message queue outside of your application and you may leverage from a decentralized and asynchronous system.

This talk will quickly go throw the basics of queues, hexagonal design and show proof of concept with Symfonyâ€™s Messenger component.
