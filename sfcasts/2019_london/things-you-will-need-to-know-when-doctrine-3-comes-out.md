## Talk Abstract

Doctrine ORM is probably the most used database abstraction in PHP. With Doctrine 3 on the horizon it's a perfect time to look at how Doctrine has changed and will change and what this means for you as users. This talk looks at some of the already merged features for Doctrine 3 that could have an impact on your code and why the might prevent you from upgrading. I will show approaches for tackling these changes and how your projects might benefit from introducing them already.
