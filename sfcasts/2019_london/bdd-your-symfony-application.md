## Talk Abstract

Behaviour Driven Development helps bridge the communication gap between business and IT. Having testable specifications is a desirable side effect.
This talk will explain the basics of BDD methodology, best practices for writing Cucumber scenarios and how to integrate Symfony with Behat by using a new emerging solution - FriendsOfBehat's SymfonyExtension. I will share the practical insights distilled from 4 years of developing and maintaining the biggest open-source Behat suite which is a part of Sylius.
