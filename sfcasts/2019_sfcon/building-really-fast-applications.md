# Building really fast applications (Tobias Nyholm)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Tobias Nyholm](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/c92dd500-ba6d-4729-a5d0-c15c254d6bb3).

Let us talk about performance. What can we do to make an application run faster? What should we be considering when starting a new application? There are some quick fixes that I will quickly cover. But to get down to really fast response times requires hard work. I will give my best ideas and tricks for fast apps. 

I will show how we can build applications that responds in less that 15ms and then work towards even faster than that.

No, this is not a Varnish talk.

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
