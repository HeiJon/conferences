# HTTP Caching with Symfony 101 (Matthias Pigulla)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Matthias Pigulla](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/2851a0ef-0a03-4891-9e28-d9e12246c7c5).

HTTP caching is a powerful technique to improve response times for site visitors, make more efficient use of bandwidth and reduce server load. We will have a look at the basic concepts, the different caching strategies and HTTP headers used to implement them. I will then show you a few ways how to implement HTTP level caching in your Symfony application, how to leverage the HTTP Cache included in the framework and resolve the mystery around ESI.

My hope is that when you return to work on monday, you will bring some new tools to your project that you can start using right away.
