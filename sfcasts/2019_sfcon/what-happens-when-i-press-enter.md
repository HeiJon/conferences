As a technical interviewer, one of the questions I like to ask the most is "what happens when I write www.example.com in the browser and then press enter?". The answer reveals a lot about the interviewee's understanding of a vast number of technologies that fringes web development.

In this talk, I will go through exactly what happens, down to excruciating detail, so that you will be better prepared for your future job interview.
