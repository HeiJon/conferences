SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Matthias Noback](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/ef854b47-59df-4655-ac8e-1b5f8a790d98).

Symfony offers many excellent components for your web and console applications. But of course, you still have to implement your own application logic, create your own domain models, and write your own tests. So Symfony has its place, but it's not going to be everywhere in your application.

In this talk I will explain an architectural style called "Hexagonal Architecture", which will help you structure your applications in such a way that you can focus most of your development effort on the core of your application, designing it in a way that makes its production code sustainable and easy to test.

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
