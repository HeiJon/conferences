# Head first into Symfony Cache, Redis & Redis Cluster (Andre Rømcke)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Andre Rømcke](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/56662e4b-9800-4add-9686-b25ea1404c6c).

[Talk slides](https://www.slideshare.net/andreromcke/symfonycon-2019-head-first-into-symfony-cache-redis-redis-cluster)

Symfony Cache has been around for a few releases. But what is happening behind the scenes? Talk focuses on how is it working, down to detail level on Redis for things like datatypes, Redis Cluster sharding logic, how it differs from Memcached and more. 

Hopefully you’ll learn how you can make sure to get optimal performance, what opportunities exists, and which pitfalls to try to avoid.

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
