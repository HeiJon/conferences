When developing APIs you sometimes need to return the same object with different representations. Furthermore, an object can be complex due to its relationships with other objects, making the serialization process such a hard task.

The Symfony Serializer Component makes it possible to manage how you want to serialize objects for JSON, XML or other formats. Also, you can manage responses using serialization groups, choosing which properties you want, handling serialization depth and much more.
