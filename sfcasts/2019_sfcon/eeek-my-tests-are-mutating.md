SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Lander Vanderstraeten](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/12a431a4-414d-4f78-8ccf-db51f8cada55).

Writing tests is nice, but how are you sure that your tests cover all use cases? Code coverage can give false positive metrics. A new way of working that goes by the name of mutation testing has gained a lot of popularity lately. This talk will explain you what it is, how you can integrate it and contains a demo over the basics of mutation testing with infection and phpspec.
