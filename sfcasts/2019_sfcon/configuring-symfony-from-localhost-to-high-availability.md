# Configuring Symfony - from localhost to High Availability (Nicolas Grekas)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Nicolas Grekas](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/072fe4aa-78a1-45c7-b802-34eb632562ef).

All apps need configuration: the database host, background color of your client's theme, API token to some service, number of items per page on the blog, etc. Where should all this configuration live? Operating systems, PHP and Symfony provide many options: environment variables, .env files, plain PHP constants, dependency injection parameters, key-value databases, "secrets" vaults, etc. You have many choices! And with great choices comes great responsibility... and complexity!

In this talk, we'll review all the ways to store configuration, which is best for each "type" of configuration and the benefits and drawbacks of each. We'll also talk about Symfony 4.4's new "secrets vault" as one of the ways to store sensitive settings. By the end, you'll be ready to configure anything from localhost up to a cluster of high resiliency microservices.
