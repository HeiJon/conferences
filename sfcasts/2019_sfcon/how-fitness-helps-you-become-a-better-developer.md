# How fitness helps you become a better developer (Magnus Nordlander)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Magnus Nordlander](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/c5e67c62-ed71-49f9-8ecc-0e4f5fcc4678).

We often think of technical skills as the way to level up as developers, but we're not (yet) brains-in-a-vat. Our body and physical health are crucial to be able to work well as developers.

In this talk I speak both about the science behind fitness and nutrition, and my personal journey of losing over 70 kgs, starting to go to the gym, how it affected me as a developer, as well as the shocking secret behind what happened to the Sound of Symfony podcast.

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
