Twig is the most powerful templating engine in the PHP world that enables us to create highly complex projects with hundreds of multi-level extended templates, thousands of blocks, functions, filters, tests, and macros. It also offers a sandbox, a unique but not a widely used feature that is creating secure user-editable templates. In addition, there are a number of handy built-in and external debugging tools available in the Twig ecosystem to simplify the day-to-day work process for a Twig designer.

In this presentation, I will talk about how extensively we use Twig in a complex open-source e-commerce project.
