# How to contribute to Symfony and why you should give it a try (Valentin Udaltsov)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Valentin Udaltsov](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/d5ee9661-dcbf-4fdf-9d61-76f51adf4360).

I started contributing actively to Symfony three years ago. Not only is it a way to thank the project, but it's also an immense source of knowledge and communication for me. I would like to share my experience and to encourage contributions to Symfony.

What we'll discuss:

* how participation in an open-source project makes you a better developer;
* easy steps to join the Symfony ecosystem;
* where to get an idea for a pull request;
* branches and roadmap;
* coding standards, conventions and backward compatibility;
* rebase flow;
* review process.
*

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
