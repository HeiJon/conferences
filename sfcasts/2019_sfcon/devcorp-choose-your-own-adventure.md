You’re a software development consultant called into DevCorp with a mission. What started as a hip, informal startup now has investor demands to meet. And they’re counting on you to help them become a scale-up. How do you grow the existing team and maintain the codebase?

This interactive talk, intended for any developer of any level, will give you some valuable technical and soft skills to take with you on your real-life professional journey. Using a voting system, the audience decides… and has to live with the consequences. Based on a mix of personal experience, agile methodology, and software design principles, this story has several possible endings.

Will you help lift your team’s performance or run DevCorp into the ground?
