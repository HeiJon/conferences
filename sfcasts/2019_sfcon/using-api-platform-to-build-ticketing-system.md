# Using API Platform to build ticketing system (Antonio Peric-Mazar)

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Antonio Peric-Mazar](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/890373d0-07da-40d2-98fa-9c3f1f8b19dc).

Why is API platform a way to go and the new standard in developing apps? In this talk, I want to show you some real examples that we built using API platform including a ticketing system for the worldâ€™s biggest bicycle marathon and a social network that is a mixture of both Tinder and Facebook Messenger.

We had to tackle problems regarding the implementation of tax laws in 18 different countries, dozens of translations (including Arabic), multiple role systems, different timezones, overall struggle with a complicated logic with an infinite number of branches, and more.
