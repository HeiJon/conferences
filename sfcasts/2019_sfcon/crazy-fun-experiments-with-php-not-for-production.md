SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Zan Baldwin](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/0e1d7cdf-904b-4c77-8f72-bb95fe7726d1).

[Talk slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cTDYd4tNHH37MKbNEm1jqdMW-NcqaVU2MLIsUWtCs7k/)

I’ll show you the crazy things you can do in PHP with streams and autoloader overloading to write your own language features. I’ll also show you how you can supercharge your Symfony applications using aspect-orientated programming or encrypt source code on-the-fly using only PHP. As if that wasn’t enough, we’ll go even further and make PHP a polyglot language by importing esoteric language scripts!
These aren’t your average hacks and shouldn’t be run in production... but let’s explore these concepts as fun experiments so you’ll never think of PHP as boring again!

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
