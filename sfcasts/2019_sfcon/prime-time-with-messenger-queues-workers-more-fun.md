SymfonyCon 2019 Amsterdam presentation by [Ryan Weaver](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/78e63a1c-dc18-456f-b60d-34b1cb075580).

In Symfony 4.4, Messenger will lose its experimental label and officially become
stable! In this talk, we'll go through Messenger from the ground-up: learning
about messages, message handlers, transports and how to consume messages asynchronously
via worker commands. Everything you need to make your app faster by delaying work
until later.

We'll also talk about the many new features that were added to Messenger since
Symfony 4.3, like retries, the failure transport and support for using Doctrine
and Redis as transports.

Let's get to work with Messenger!

Transcript & caption for the talk will be added soon.
